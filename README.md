# Game-of-Life
<p>The Game of Life, introduced by a British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.</p>
A game where you define an unpredictable cell automaton, which is a grid of cells, where each has a finite number of states such as on or off. It consists of an infinite, two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells and revolves around a set of rules which will recursively interact with the current state of the grid.
